# Simple Tic Tac Toe Game in Python

## Overview

This is a simple console-based implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game in Python. The game allows two players to take turns making moves on a 3x3 grid until one player wins by having three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), or the game ends in a draw.

## How to Play

1. **Run the Game:**
   - Execute the Python script (`tic_tac_toe.py`) in a terminal or command prompt.
   - The game initializes, and the empty Tic Tac Toe board is displayed.

2. **Making Moves:**
   - Players take turns entering their moves by inputting a number from 1 to 9.
   - The board is represented as follows:
     ```
     1 | 2 | 3
     ---------
     4 | 5 | 6
     ---------
     7 | 8 | 9
     ```
   - Each number corresponds to a position on the grid.

3. **Winning Conditions:**
   - A player wins if they have three of their symbols (X or O) in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).
   - The game declares a draw if all positions on the board are filled, and no winner is determined.

## Implementation Details

- The game is implemented using a 2D list to represent the game board.
- Player moves are taken as input, and the board is updated accordingly.
- The game checks for winning conditions after each move.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the Python script (`tic_tac_toe.py`).
4. Run the game by executing the command: `python tic_tac_toe.py`.
